## Prerequisites/Requirements

- Need to create an app for your extension in the [Twitch Dev Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)
  - In the management view of your app in the Twitch Dev console be sure to add `http://localhost:40475/` (\*note the trailing `/` ) to your OAuth Redirect URLs
- Get the Client ID string that Twitch provides for your application and save it somewhere. You will need it later in your extension code.

## Getting Started

1. Update your extension `package.json` with the following:
   ```json
   "extensionDependencies": [
     "clarkio.vscode-twitch-authprovider"
   ],
   ```
2. Then to initiate an authenticated session in your extension you'll need to use the following code:
   ```javascript
   const twitchSession = await vscode.authentication.getSession(
     "twitch", // Always use this as it identifies the authentication provider to use
     ["TWITCH_CLIENT_ID:<your-client-id>", "chat:read", "chat:edit"], // The Twitch API scopes you wish to request permission for from the user.
     { createIfNone: true } // An option that will create a new session if one isn't already found
   );
   ```
   > âš  As part of the scopes you need to provide your Twitch App Client ID as a separate "scope" using the following convention: "TWITCH_CLIENT_ID:\<your-client-id>" âš 
3. After you have successfully create an authenticated session `twitchSession` will consist of the following that you can use how you choose:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "A string of a unique identifier for the authenticated session",
     "accessToken": "A string representing the Twitch provided token for the user that authorized your extension/app",
     "account": {
       "id": "A string of a unique identifier for the user account",
       "label": "A string of the human readable user name"
     },
     "scopes": "An array of strings for the scopes associated with the authenticated session"
   }
   ```
